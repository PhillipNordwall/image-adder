# image-adder
Add an image next to occurences of a word in a webpage.


## Purpose
This repository is to help teach my kids (or others) about opensource and get them comfortable with version control, as well as with a programming language. Hacktoberfest is a neat way to do this that has inspired them.

## Program
The idea for this project came from my son, who wanted to accomplish the following.
1) Be able to find a specific word.
2) Be able to update it with more information

We think by modifying this to do the following opens the oportunity for more collaboration, including that from non-programmers in the form of art.
1) Be able to display/proxy a webpage.
2) Be able to add an image next to a word/pattern in the page.
3) Have the image selected from all the images uin a directory.

## Language
We are doing this with python, but if others want to make contributions meeting the program goals in other top-level directories that would be awesome. Please make sure there is a README.md describing usage and thoughts.
