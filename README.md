Add an image next to occurences of a word in a webpage.


## Purpose
This repository is to help teach my kids (or others) about opensource and get them comfortable with version control, as well as with a programming language. Hacktoberfest is a neat way to do this that has inspired them.

## Program
The idea for this project came from my son, who wanted to accomplish the following.
1) Be able to find a specific word.
2) Be able to update it with more information
